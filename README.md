## 🧰 Developer in the Wild

Strategic and performance-driven **Full-Stack Developer**, primarily focused on **Laravel + Vue** ecosystems. I build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications that don’t require a fire extinguisher every sprint.

I thrive on writing clean backend code in PHP, exploring JS frameworks, and figuring out how to Dockerize anything that dares run on a server. Currently upskilling in **React**, **Next.js**, and **Go** — because why stop at one frontend framework or one compiled language?

- 🧠 I'm slowly transitioning from “Googler” to “Engineer”.
